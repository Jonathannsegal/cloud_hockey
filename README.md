The "PhoneKebab" Cloud Hockey project is a project which combined accessible digital technologies with the power of physics to enhance the analytics of hockey, a sport that's enjoyed by millions annually. With our solution, users can monitor and analyze their performances in hockey with ease. Requiring almost no setting-up and no apps installation, all you need is a basic-level smart device and an internet connection to get started!

## Overview 🗺️

We detect the movements in users' phone and calculate analytical data based on our advanced physics algorithm. We show users data including their live location on the hockey rink, the acceleration of the hockey stick, the calories burned, recommended food item from Panera Bread to get based on energy burned, and etc.

## Running Locally 💻

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Jonathannsegal/cloud_hockey.git
$ cd cloud_hockey
$ open index.html
$ datastuff - data dashboard
$ tape phone to hockeystick
$ go to hockeystick on phone to track data
```
## Tools 🧰

Google Cloud Firebase as the base technology used in our solution, it enables real-time data transmission between the sensor devices (i.e. phones) and the computers. We also used Snapchat Bitmoji Kit and Panera Bread nutrition data to empower our product.

## Pickhacks 🥈

This project won 2nd place overall at Pickhacks.
